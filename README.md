# flashier

This package is in active development. The interface is likely to change from time to time.

Before diving in, I recommend taking a look at the vignettes. Do note, however, that they take a few minutes to build (it took me a little less than 5 minutes on a 2015 13" MacBook Pro). To build them, run:

```devtools::install_github("willwerscheid/flashier", build_vignettes = TRUE)```

There are two vignettes:

```vignette("intro", package = "flashier")```

```vignette("advanced", package = "flashier")```
